# System Detailed Guide


This Python code includes several classes and functions for system operations, color handling, email sending, SQLite logging, and console printing.

1. **System Class**
- This class contains methods for interacting with the system. It includes methods for clearing the console, setting the console size, resetting the program, and executing system commands.

2. **Colors Class**
- This class contains static methods for handling ANSI color codes. It includes methods for creating ANSI color codes, removing ANSI color codes, starting a color sequence, getting the number of leading spaces in a string, and mixing colors.

3. **Col Class**
- This class contains predefined ANSI color codes for easy use.

Here is an example of how to use these classes and functions:

```python

    # Initialize the system
    Terminal = System()
    Terminal.Init()

    # Clear the console
    Terminal.Clear()

    # Set the console size
    Terminal.Size(80, 24)

    # Print a message to the console
    Console("127.0.0.1", "Hello, World!", "Green")
```
